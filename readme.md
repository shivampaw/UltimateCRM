## Requirements / Installation / Usage / Troubleshooting
Need help getting started? Here's where to look!
### Requirements
This CRM runs with Laravel 5.4 for which the requirements are as follows:
* PHP >= 5.6.4
* OpenSSL PHP Extension
* PDO PHP Extension
* Mbstring PHP Extension
* Tokenizer PHP Extension
* XML PHP Extension

### Installation
To install run the following commands in a working directory:
`git clone https://github.com/shivampaw/UltimateCRM.git`

You will then need to change your web server root to the public directory. Contact your host for help if you need it.

Now run `composer install` and make sure you have composer installed on your server!

Then setup your database and open the `.env.example` file. Rename this file to `.env` and enter details for your site, database, stripe and email integration.

Run `php artisan key:generate` from the root project folder.

Run `php artisan migrate` from the root project folder. This will create the database tables for you.

Now you can setup your Super Admin account by running `php artisan super_admin:create` which will walk you through creating the account.

You also need to add a crontab with the following details: `* * * * * php /path/to/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1` Edit the /path/to/artisan to your actual artisan path. Artisan is the file in the root directory of the project. You should be able to do this by logging into your server via SSH and running `crontab -e`. Then just paste the above line correctly. **This step is optional and only required if you want to use recurring invoices**.

You should then be able to access UltimateCRM easily!

### Usage
You can edit the .env to configure most of the settings the CRM uses.

If you want to edit the display of the "views" then you can do so by adding the files in the `resources/customViews/` directory.
For example, if you place a file in `resources/customViews/emails/invoices/new.blade.php` that file will be used when emailing the client about a new invoice instead of the default in `resources/views/emails/invoices/new.blade.php`. You can therefore edit all the views that come with UltimateCRM by default.

If you want to add a custom CSS file you can add in in the `public/css` directory and then load that file in your `app.blade.php` view - be sure to override the default one though!
